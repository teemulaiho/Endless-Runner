## Instructions for Teacher

- Win/Lose Condition: Player loses if all lives are lost. Player "wins" by reaching higher scores than before.
- Main Game States: MenuState, PlayState, GameOverState.
- Menu Easing: Menu buttons shake when hovered over.
- Collision Detection: Enemies are moved away from each other if colliding.
- Keyframe animations: Player has run, jump & hurt animations.
- Background Parallax Srolling: 10 layers.
- Screen Shake: Screen shakes if player hit by enemy.
- Configuration File: Set resolution, player lives & enemy speed increase (by %). EndlessRunner/text_configuration.txt .

## Introduction 

The goal of this assignment is to write an [endless runner](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Platform_game#Endless_running_games) game in 2D, using C++ and SDL, with an emphasis on **game feel**. An endless runner is a specialization of the platformer genre where the player is always moving forwards. The genre was popularized the game [Temple Run](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Temple_Run).

The reason for picking this genre is that the core mechanic is easy to understand and easy to implement - we can have a simple input scheme with just one button - this lets us focus on the feel of the game. We try to maximize how the game is perceived using various audio-visual effects and techniques such as screen shake and fitting sound effects.

Go check out [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Platform_game#Endless_running_games) or [itch.io](https://itch.io/games/accessibility-one-button/tag-infinite-runner) for inspiration.

## Pass

The following features are required for a **pass**

### Win/Lose Conditions

The player must be able to win in some way and in the case of a game like a endless runner - a high score of some kind - length run or time survived. In this type of game the lose condition then becomes not being able to continue "running".

### Main Game States

There must be at least three different **main** game states in the game e.g *MenuState*, *PlayState* and *GameOverState*. These states can, and probably should, have sub-states such as the *PlayState* having a *PlayPausedState* and the *MenuState* having a *MenuSettingsState* and *MenuReplayState*.

### Menu Easing

Easing is usually added to user interface elements and menu items to make the presentation look more interesting. Easing being a term coined by Robert Penner that is referring to different functions that adds flavour to motion.

### Collision Detection and Resolve

A game is not complete without good collision detection and resolve in 2D. This is achieved by using algorithms to find if two colliders intersect or overlap, and then resolve the potential intersection by moving either object, depending if one of them is a static non-movable object or not, the penetration distance so that they no longer intersect. The collision detection algorithms developed in previous assignment comes in handy.

### Keyframe Animations

The game needs to have at least three different animations with three or more keyframes. The behaviour for the animations can be the same, i.e they can all be looping. The animation code from previous assignment comes in handy.

### Background Parallax Scrolling

The background in the play state must be using [parallax scrolling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parallax_scrolling) with three or more layers.

### Screen Shake

In the games play state there should be some kind of screen shake effect during game play. Remember that some people are sensitive to flashing lights, so don't over do it.

### Configuration File

The game must read a configuration file that has at least three settings required for the game. E.g size of the window as width and height (note: this is one setting since it does not make sense to have one without the other) or some factor of the amount of screen shake allowed et cetera.

### Music and Sound Effects

Background music must be played and appropriate sound effects must be played when some kind of event happens in game, e.g player shoots or an enemy is hit by bullet.

## Pass with Distinction

All features of **Pass** and the following features are required for a **Pass with Distinction**

### Particle Effects

Two or more particle effects should be rendered in the game. E.g shattered glass when the player jumps though a window or the smoke in the background in [Canabalt](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMBg75_TiLw). But it can also be something in the main menu or even in a loading screen.

### Replay Recording and Playback

During play the input of the player is recorded first to a buffer in memory then, when the player hits one lose condition, the content of the recording (i.e memory buffer) is written to file on disk. 

This newly recorded and saved replay, or a previously recorded replay, can then be selected in the main menu and played back. The replay feature should have a history of replays to select from.

## TL;DR for the features required for different grades

**Pass**

- Win/lose conditions
- 3+ game states
- Easing
- Collision detection and resolve
- 3+ different keyframe animations
- 3+ layers of background parallax scrolling
- Camera shake
- 3+ settings configuration file
- Music and Sound Effects

**Pass with Distinction**

- All features of Pass
- 2+ particle effects
- Replay recording and playback

## Grading

This assignment has Pass, Pass with Distinction or Fail. For a Pass, all the required features in the Pass section of this document must be implemented
correctly. 
For a Pass with Distinction, all the features for Pass must be implemented correctly in addition to all required features for Pass with Distinction.
Failing the steps defined in the Requirements section and Hand-in section will lead to a Fail.

## Requirements

This is a individual or group assignment. Original code written by the student(s) with C/C++. Example code
and provided external code by course responsible can and should be used as a starting point
for the laboratory.

## Plagiarism

At university, we are continuously engaged with other people's ideas - we read about them, we
discuss them in class and we write about them in our assignments. It is therefore important that
we acknowledge these people in our assignments/projects/papers that we submit for marks. If
we do not adhere to these basic requirements, we are making ourselves guilty of a gross
violation of the academic standard.
Academic dishonesty in any form including, but not limited to plagiarism and collusion, cheating
in tests, examinations and assignments, theses and research papers, is regarded as a serious
offence and will be dealt with in terms of the provisions of the Universityâ€™s Disciplinary Rules for
Students.
